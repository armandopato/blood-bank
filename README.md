# blood-bank

A basic command line **C program** that lets the users manipulate a csv file, simulating a blood bank data system.

This program was my final project of the **Programming Fundamentals** class, taught in the first semester of the Computer Engineering program at UNAM's Faculty of Engineering.

Basic programming principles and techniques were used, such as **modularity** and the **linked list** data structure.
