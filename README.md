# blood-bank

Command line **C program** to manipulate CSV files, simulating a blood bank data system

This program was my final project of the **Programming Fundamentals** class, taught in the first semester of the Computer Engineering program at UNAM Faculty of Engineering.

Applied fundamental programming and design principles, e.g. **modularity** and the **linked list** data structure.
